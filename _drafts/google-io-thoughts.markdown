The dust has settled on Google I/O 2015.  There has been plenty to dig into and we are likely to be picking through videos of the sessions and follow-up announcements and releases over the coming weeks.

Here are some of thoughts from the team about what has caught our attention from Google I/O this year.

**Project Jacquard**

In this project Google is literally weaving in touch enabled fibers to any clothing. While in the demo clothing these fibers were visible the promise from the team was that these fibers can be made completely invisible. The fiber touch surface is connected to a small transmitter that can be placed into a discrete inner pocket and can easily be removed when the clothing is being washed.

Now, what does this actually enable us to do? 

There's few immediate and obvious applications. With this technology we can add touch controls to our jeans pockets for example. With these small touch surfaces we can control music playback, answer phone calls etc. 

While thees initial and obvious use cases might not be mind-bendingly amazing this is one of those technologies that if it can be put into production efficiently can truly change the way we interact with our devices. All the sudden smart textiles start making sense. Once this technology is in the market without driving the textile costs up too much) innovation in this field will expand very rapidly.

**Android M: Permissions**

I have mixed feelings about this I/O announcement.  On the one hand I like how permission changes become decopuled from app updates so the automatic update will hopefully flow more readily.  There is also a strong case for giving more control to users who will no longer be forced into an 'all or nothing' scenario will app permissions.

On the other hand, I'm a little unhappy to see permission popups that are reminiscent of iOS. I've never liked the way the user interaction is interrupted on iOS to request permission to perform an action. I appreciate that the security popups are shown only once per permission, but it still feels a little annoying to me.

**Google Cloud Messaging**

I was very pleased to see that GCM will become a cross-platform messaging solution. Having to juggle multiple messaging providers adds some complexity to back-ends which we have experienced recently on a few projects.

Also, topic based messaging is a welcome addition that I hope helps people offer more options for users to sign-up to only those messages that they find meaningful.

**App Indexing**

Although there are some concerns that content owners might harbour about Google having even greater access to their content, there is no doubt that search is a key part of bringing users to our apps - users are why we build apps in the first place.

Google's cross platform commitment is also encouraging - it's great to see them solve common problems for all mobile devs which is in contrast to others...

**Cloud Test Lab**

There wasn't enough information about this to know how much Google are giving developers as part of a free testing tier, however it's very encouraging that they have contemplated some sort of free offering which integrates with the Google Play Alpha and Beta app channels. 

I'm a little cautious about the wording on the Early Access sign-up form, which talks about 'automatically scanning', rather than actual test execution. Where Google can really impress, is by providing the custom testing at a reasonable price.

Let's hope Cloud Test Lab turns out to be affordable, flexible and practical when launched later this year.
