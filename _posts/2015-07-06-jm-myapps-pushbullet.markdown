Today I'm writing about <a href="https://www.pushbullet.com" target="_blank">Pushbullet</a> - a great tool when you have multiple devices.

Pushbullet enables you to send links and files between devices.  Most often, I find myself using it to send screenshots taken from a phone/tablet to my laptop to file a bug report.  It's also great if you want to send a URL from your laptop browser to a mobile device. 

Although it is possible to send to other people from Pushbullet, I tend to do this via Slack - primarily so that we can keep all project communication consolidated.


Pushbullet is free.  For mobile devices, there are apps for <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pushbullet.android" target="_blank"><u>Android</u></a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pushbullet/id810352052?ls=1&mt=8" target="_blank"><u>iOS</u></a> - you can either send from the Pushbullet app, aor share from another app using Intents/Share Sheet. For computers, there are browser plugins for <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chlffgpmiacpedhhbkiomidkjlcfhogd" target="_blank"><u>Chrome</u></a>, <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/pushbullet/versions/" target="_blank"><u>Firefox</u></a>, <a href="http://update.pushbullet.com/extension.safariextz" target="_blank"><u>Safari</u></a> and <a href="https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/pushbullet/" target="_blank"><u>Opera</u></a> as well as <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pushbullet-from-pushbullet/id948415170?ls=1&mt=12" target="_blank"><u>OSX</u></a> and <a href="https://update.pushbullet.com/pushbullet_installer.exe" target="_blank"><u>Windows</u></a> apps.

Recently, the guys at Pushbullet have been adding other features which I haven't tried yet.  These include sending/receiving SMS from your computer, seeing device notifications on your computer and something called 'Channels' which is something like a news feed.
