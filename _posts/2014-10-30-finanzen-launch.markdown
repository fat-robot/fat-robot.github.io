We are delighted to see the release of the finanzen.net Android app from Axel Springer. We are bound to be little proud â€“  we helped them craft the UX and bring a lovely Android experience to life.

The story began when the finanzen.net team approached us to help advise them on how to take the existing Android experience (a clone of their iOS app) and create an Android app that would stand next to the best in the Play Store.

A key component to the engagement was helping the Finanzen team understand how Android UI guidelines could be applied in their context which also meant bringing the app to multiple screen sizes. This was no mean feat given the expanse and depth of the the Finanzen.net product.

We think the result is a great Android app that shows how data-rich content can be structured and browsed with great UX.
