The dust has settled on Google I/O 2015.  There has been plenty to dig into and we are likely to be picking through videos of the sessions and follow-up announcements and releases over the coming weeks.

Here are some initial thoughts about what has caught my attention from Google I/O this year.

**Android M: Permissions**

I have mixed feelings about this I/O announcement.  On the one hand I like how permission changes become decopuled from app updates so the automatic update will hopefully flow more readily.  There is also a strong case for giving more control to users who will no longer be forced into an 'all or nothing' scenario will app permissions.

On the other hand, I'm a little unhappy to see permission popups that are reminiscent of iOS. I've never liked the way the user interaction is interrupted on iOS to request permission to perform an action. I appreciate that the security popups are shown only once per permission, but it still feels a little annoying to me.

**Google Cloud Messaging**

I was very pleased to see that GCM will become a cross-platform messaging solution. Having to juggle multiple messaging providers adds some complexity to back-ends which we have experienced recently on a few projects.

Also, topic based messaging is a welcome addition that I hope helps people offer more options for users to sign-up to only those messages that they find meaningful.

**App Indexing**

Although there are some concerns that content owners might harbour about Google having even greater access to their content, there is no doubt that search is a key part of bringing users to our apps - users are why we build apps in the first place.

Google's cross platform commitment is also encouraging - it's great to see them solve common problems for all mobile devs which is in contrast to others...

**Cloud Test Lab**

There wasn't enough information about this to know how much Google are giving developers as part of a free testing tier, however it's very encouraging that they have contemplated some sort of free offering which integrates with the Google Play Alpha and Beta app channels. 

I'm a little cautious about the wording on the Early Access sign-up form, which talks about 'automatically scanning', rather than actual test execution. Where Google can really impress, is by providing the custom testing at a reasonable price.

Let's hope Cloud Test Lab turns out to be affordable, flexible and practical when launched later this year.

There's plenty more that I haven't explored in enough detail yet...but certainly some positive evolutionary changes coming to Android.
